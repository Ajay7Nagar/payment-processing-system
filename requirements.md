# Payment Processing System Requirements

## Functional Requirements
1. **FR-1 Purchase Flow**: Provide endpoints to execute an Authorize.Net purchase (auth+capture) in a single call and persist the transaction outcome with correlation IDs.
2. **FR-2 Two-Step Flow**: Offer endpoints to authorize a payment and capture it later, enforcing state transitions and persistence.
3. **FR-3 Cancel Flow**: Allow cancellation of authorized-but-not-captured transactions with state persisted and audit logged.
4. **FR-4 Refund Flow**: Support full and partial refunds for settled transactions, updating balances, histories, and audit logs.
5. **FR-5 Subscription Lifecycle**: Manage subscriptions end to end (create, update, pause, resume, cancel) with schedules (monthly, weekly, every N days), trials, and proration handling.
6. **FR-6 Dunning & Retry**: Execute retries on failed subscription charges using exponential backoff (0d, 1d, 3d, 7d) and auto-cancel at 30 days.
7. **FR-7 Webhook Intake**: Ingest Authorize.Net webhooks for payment, refund, subscription, and settlement events with authenticated delivery and deduplication.
8. **FR-8 Idempotent Operations**: Ensure duplicate client calls or webhook retries are processed exactly once using idempotency keys and persisted replay protection.
9. **FR-9 JWT Protection**: Require and validate RS256 JWTs for all service endpoints, embedding user roles.
10. **FR-10 Single-Tenant Data Model**: Operate as a single-tenant system; all data scoped globally without tenant identifiers.
11. **FR-11 Persistence Layer**: Store orders, transactions, webhook payloads, subscription states, settlement IDs, and audit metadata with correlation IDs.
12. **FR-12 Error Handling**: Return structured error payloads (code, message, remediation) for validation and gateway failures.
13. **FR-13 Compliance Logging**: Capture immutable audit logs for every state-changing operation, retained ≥7 years.
14. **FR-14 Observability Metrics**: Emit metrics for transaction volumes, subscription lifecycle events, webhook queue depth, and error rates.
15. **FR-15 Daily Settlement Export**: Generate end-of-day exports (CSV/JSON) of settled transactions, including settlement batch IDs, accessible via S3 or downloadable API.
16. **FR-16 Environment Parity**: Maintain dev, test, staging, and prod environments with staging mirroring production configuration and quotas.
17. **FR-17 Compliance API**: Provide authenticated APIs for compliance officers to query audit logs filtered by date range and operation type.

## Non-Functional Requirements
1. **NFR-1 Availability**: Achieve ≥99.9% availability per calendar month at the production API gateway using Kubernetes rolling deployments and health probes.
2. **NFR-2 Latency**: Critical flows (purchase, refund, subscription charge) in staging and prod meet p95 <300 ms and p99 <500 ms excluding Authorize.Net response time under 20 concurrent requests.
3. **NFR-3 Security**: JWTs expire within 60 minutes, RS256 signatures verified against trusted keys, and invalid tokens generate audit entries.
4. **NFR-4 Privacy & GDPR**: Support soft-delete and anonymization of customer PII within 24 hours of request while retaining transaction identifiers; redact PII from logs.
5. **NFR-5 Data Retention**: Retain PII for 2 years and financial records plus audit logs for 7 years with immutability guarantees.
6. **NFR-6 Scalability**: Queue-backed webhook processing sustains bursts of 100 events per minute, draining backlog within 2 minutes once load subsides.
7. **NFR-7 Observability**: Emit distributed tracing, structured logs with correlation IDs, and expose `/metrics` refreshed at least every 60 seconds.
8. **NFR-8 Environment Consistency**: Staging environment mirrors production configuration within ±5% resource quotas and uses masked but realistic sandbox data.
9. **NFR-9 Compliance Readiness**: Logging, access controls, and retention support PCI DSS SAQ-A and SOC2 Type II readiness (role separation, immutable audit logs).
10. **NFR-10 Test Coverage**: Maintain ≥80% automated unit test coverage, validated in continuous integration across service, domain, and integration layers.

## Acceptance Tests
1. **AT-1 (FR-1, FR-11, NFR-2)**: Execute purchase flow in staging under 20 concurrent requests; verify Authorize.Net success, persisted transaction with correlation ID, and latency p95 <300 ms/p99 <500 ms excluding gateway time.
2. **AT-2 (FR-2, FR-8, NFR-1)**: Authorize then capture a payment; replay capture with the same idempotency key and confirm idempotent response without state change and availability targets met.
3. **AT-3 (FR-3, FR-12, NFR-5)**: Cancel an authorized transaction; verify state change, audit log retention, and structured success response. Invalid cancel attempt returns error payload with remediation guidance.
4. **AT-4 (FR-4, FR-6, NFR-6)**: Process full and partial refunds; trigger dunning on failed charges, confirm retry cadence and auto-cancel at 30 days, with queue backlog drained within 2 minutes.
5. **AT-5 (FR-5, FR-10, NFR-4)**: Create subscriptions with trials and proration credits; process soft-delete request and validate PII anonymized within 24 hours while transaction IDs remain intact.
6. **AT-6 (FR-7, FR-14, NFR-7)**: Inject 100 webhook events in 1 minute; confirm authenticated intake, deduplication, metrics for queue depth/error rate, and logs with correlation IDs.
7. **AT-7 (FR-9, NFR-3, NFR-9)**: Call protected endpoints with expired and tampered JWTs; expect HTTP 401, audit log entries, and verification against trusted keys.
8. **AT-8 (FR-15, FR-16, NFR-8)**: Generate daily settlement export in staging mirroring production quotas; verify settlement IDs match Authorize.Net reports and exports available via S3/API.
9. **AT-9 (FR-13, FR-17, NFR-5, NFR-9)**: Access compliance API as authorized officer; confirm immutable logs retained ≥7 years, filters by date/operation function, and modification attempts are rejected.
10. **AT-10 (FR-11, FR-12, NFR-10)**: Run CI pipeline to execute unit tests covering transaction persistence and error handling; ensure ≥80% coverage reported and failure blocks deployment.
