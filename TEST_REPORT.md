# Test Report â€“ 2025-09-29

## Summary
- `./gradlew clean test` executed successfully after queue-backed webhook implementation.
- Total tests: 33
- Passed: 33
- Failed: 0
- Ignored: 0
- Duration: ~10.5 seconds

## Coverage
- Jacoco HTML and XML reports generated under `build/reports/jacoco/test/html` and `build/reports/jacoco/test/jacocoTestReport.xml`.
- Critical services (`PaymentCommandService`, `SubscriptionService`, `PaymentAuditService`, `ComplianceAuditService`) maintain >90% coverage.
- Webhook queue listener/scheduler tests ensure retry logic and message handling now covered.
- Settlement exports and compliance controllers retain high branch coverage, guaranteeing SLA-critical code paths are validated.

## Notable Scenarios
- Payments domain: purchase, authorize, capture, cancel, and refund flows verified with happy-path and edge conditions.
- Subscriptions domain: creation, update, pause/resume/cancel flows tested alongside retry backoff scheduling and dunning recording.
- Compliance module: pagination and filtering queries for audit logs, plus unauthorized access behavior.
- Webhook pipeline: signature validation, persistence, queue publishing, worker consumption, and stale requeue validated.
- Global exception handler assertions ensure consistent error payloads for domain exceptions and validation failures.

## Next Steps
- Extend integration tests with Testcontainers (PostgreSQL + RabbitMQ) to exercise end-to-end webhook processing.
- Add metrics-based assertions verifying presence of key Micrometer counters (payments, webhooks, settlements) under Actuator endpoints.
- Include load/perf test summaries (k6) once non-functional validation is executed.
